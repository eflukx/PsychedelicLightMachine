# Runtime configuration file to initialise time constants,
# parallel port, logging and port mode (sp12 native or Kanda 
# compatible).
# Sp12 will make this file when first started; it will appear 
# in the directory as defined by the environment variable SP12,
# or in the current directory if this variable is not set.
# The next time sp12 starts, time constants, port address, logging
# parameters and port mode will be read from this file.
# The primary parallel port address will be automatically selected.
# if you need to use, for instance, the secondary (0x278), then
# by all means edit this file manually, but don't change the *format*
# of the NNNN=ddd type statements, only the values. Note that
# BYTEWRITE is an upper limit; the value actually used is dynamically
# adjusted when sp12 runs. Check changes.doc for other details.

# NO parallel port at 0x278
# Parallel port available at 0x378
# NO parallel port at 0x3BC
# This port address will be used:
PORT=0x378
# Set KANDA=1 to adapt parallel port pinout:
# to the cable/dongles supplied with the
# Atmel/Kanda STK200/300 starter kits.
# When KANDA=0 (default) the pinout conforms
# to the original SP12 cable and Ken Huntington's
# dongle.
KANDA=0
# Set log path/file to log writes and locks
# to less than 200 characters:
LOGPATH=sp12log.txt
# Set logging=1 to activate logging:
LOGGING=0
# Set both logging and query=1 to always query writes:
QUERY=0
# Time constant for 50ms will be:
RESETPULS=13620885
# Chip erase delay, 120ms ATMega, 20ms others:
CHIPERASE=80
# Time constant for 200ms will be:
POWERON=200
# Set clockSpdDefault to a suitable value in MHz.
CLOCKSPDDEFAULT=7
# Do not change anything below this line.
